## TL;DR (Too long; Didn't Read): git Edition

- Don't use `master` unless it is a brand new project and hasn't been deployed
- Name your branches `[initials]-[feature description]`, always with hyphens between words
- Use [karma style commit messages](http://karma-runner.github.io/2.0/dev/git-commit-msg.html)
- Try to avoid anything too crazy like rebasing branches others are actively using
